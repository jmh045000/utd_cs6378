TO COMPILE
'make'
If you're on cs1.utdallas.edu
'make -j12'
will compile much faster

This build takes a few minutes, it first downloads the GNU GMP library from the internet, extracts it, makes it, then compiles my source code.
(I asked the professor before using GNU GMP, and he said it was fine.)

TO RUN
'./hw2'


My code resides in hw2.cpp Weight.{h,cpp} Events.{h,cpp}

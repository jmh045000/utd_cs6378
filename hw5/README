To build:
make

To run:
cd ex[1-4] ; ../hw5


I've included 4 examples.
Each example has an events.txt, topology.txt, and answer.txt file.

The events and topology file can have comments, if the line starts with a '#'.  Example 1 shows the use of this and details the formatting of the events file.

The spacing in the events and topology file can be any form of whitespace, I used tabs to stay consistent with Dr. McMahan.
The answer (and report) files are organized as such:
<process>:<type of event> [more info]
where <process> is the process performing an event
<type of event> can be one of: S, R, C, PERM, or UNDO
S is a send event, if a process sends a message
[more info] = <process which will receive the message> <type of message> <seq no>
R is a receive event
[more info] = <sending process> <type of message> <seq no>
In the above two, type of message can be A, C, or R.  Where A is an APP message, C is a checkpoint request, R is a checkpoint reply
C is a checkpoint event
[more info] = nothing/'T'
where 'T' signifies taking a tentative checkpoint

PERM/UNDO means taking a permanent checkpoint or undoing a tentative checkpoint.

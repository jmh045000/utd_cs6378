This project can build two executables.
One uses a real distributed mutex to allow access to the critical section in hw3.cpp
The other is a fake mutex that simply returns as soon as it's called.

When running both of these, it is easy to see that there is contention among the processes.
In the real mutex version, the output is the same on every line, and each process prints 10 lines.
In the fake version, the output becomes jumbled and mixed up, as each process writes to the file at the same time.

To build the real mutex:
make -B

To build the fake mutex:
make fakedmutex

To test:
./test <host1> <host2> ... <hostN>
Where N can be up to 25

This test creates the configuration files, then executes the program on all the hosts specified.
It then compares the output file, in ~/dmutextestdir/dmutextest, to make sure that it matches the expected output.  That is, every line is equal to "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog ", and there are 10*<N> lines in the file.
If the comparison fails, the output is printed, which is the case for a fake mutex.
